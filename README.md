🐍 Snake Game

A simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python's turtle module. This project is ideal for practicing fundamental programming concepts like loops, functions, and game development logic.

📜 Description

The Snake Game is a timeless arcade game where the player controls a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen boundaries. As the snake eats, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.

This version of the game is built entirely with Python and the turtle module, demonstrating basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and game mechanics.

🚀 Features

Dynamic Gameplay: The snake grows longer as it eats.

Simple Controls: Use the keyboard to change the snake's direction.

Collision Detection: Game over if the snake hits itself or the boundaries.

Customizable: Modify colors, speed, and screen size easily.
