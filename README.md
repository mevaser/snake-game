🐍 Snake Game

A complete and engaging implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python's turtle module. This project demonstrates modular design and the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

📜 Description

The Snake Game is a timeless arcade game where the player controls a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen boundaries. As the snake eats, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.

This project features a modular design with separate classes for the snake, food, and scoreboard, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

🚀 Features

Dynamic Gameplay: The snake grows longer as it eats.
Score Tracking: Displays the current score and high score.
Collision Detection: Ends the game when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
Modular Design: Organized code with Snake, Food, and Scoreboard classes.
Customizable: Easily modify colors, speed, and screen size.
